## Random Maths

### Exponents

- Two examples of expanding the exponent are: $3^4 = 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 \cdot 3 = 81$ and $2^{-3} = \left(\frac{1}{2}\right)^3 = \frac{1}{2^3} = \frac{1}{2 \cdot 2 \cdot 2} = \frac{1}{8}$
- A root of a number involves a fractional exponent; for example, the quantity $x^{\frac{1}{n}}$ is the nth root of $x$.
- When multiplying powers of the same base, add the exponents together: $x^a \cdot x^b = x^{a+b}$.
- When dividing powers of the same base, subtract the exponents: $\frac{x^a}{x^b} = x^{a-b}$.
- Any number except zero when raised to the power of zero equals one: $n^3 \div n^3 = n^{3-3} = n^0 = 1$ as long as $n \neq 0$.
- The power of a power is: $(a^m)^p = a^{m \cdot p}$; for example, $(2^3)^4 = 2^{3 \cdot 4} = 2^{12}$.
- When raising two numbers to the same power, their products and quotients obey simple rules: $(x^n)(y^n) = (xy)^n$ and $\frac{x^n}{y^n} = \left(\frac{x}{y}\right)^n$.

### Misc

- The equation to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit is: $F = C \cdot \frac{9}{5} + 32$.
- The equation of a unit circle is: $x^2 + y^2 = 1$.
- The relationship between sine and cosine is famously shown with the Pythagorean identity: $\sin^2\theta + \cos^2\theta = 1$.
- The tangent function is defined as: $\tan\theta = \frac{\sin\theta}{\cos\theta}$.
- The absolute value or modulus of a complex number $a + bi$ is given by: $|a + bi| = \sqrt{a^2 + b^2}$.
- In Boyle's law, the product of pressure (P) and volume (V) is a constant number (k): $P \cdot V = k$, which means that pressure is inversely proportional to the volume.
- The formula for the time complexity of an algorithm can be expressed as: $T(n) = O(n^k)$, where $k$ is a constant.
- The formula for calculating the area of a rectangle is: $A = l \cdot w$, where $l$ is the length and $w$ is the width.
- The formula for the Euclidean distance between two points $(x_1, y_1)$ and $(x_2, y_2)$ is: $d = \sqrt{(x_2 - x_1)^2 + (y_2 - y_1)^2}$.
- The formula for the Fibonacci sequence is: $F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)$ with base cases $F(0) = 0$ and $F(1) = 1$.
- The formula for the sum of a geometric series is: $S_n = a \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}$ for $r \neq 1$, where $a$ is the first term and $r$ is the common ratio.
